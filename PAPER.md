## Abstract

We introduce the Point of Creation Framework (PCF), a domain-agnostic metric for detecting generative self-governance in time series:

**δ = ρ₁(Δ²X) + 2/3**

where Δ²X is the second difference of any observable scalar sequence and ρ₁ is its lag-1 autocorrelation. The expected value under white noise is exactly −2/3; thus δ > 0 indicates structure above the floor — evidence of generative dynamics. A value δ ≈ 0 indicates collapse to the white-noise floor.

We apply this framework across four domains:

1. **Prime gaps** (3×10⁸ primes): δ = +0.154 [95% CI: +0.152, +0.156], stable across sample sizes from N = 10⁵ to N = 3×10⁸. A clockwise rotation bias in mod-24 residue transitions was observed (22.1% vs. 12.5% uniform expectation; 1.77× enrichment, p < 0.01 against shuffle and phase-randomized surrogates).

2. **Cardiac dynamics** (PhysioNet HRV): Healthy subjects (n = 54) show δ̄ = +0.029 ± 0.065 (p = 0.002), significantly above the white-noise floor. Congestive heart failure patients (n = 29) show δ̄ = +0.016 ± 0.086 (p = 0.33), not significantly different from zero. The between-group difference was not statistically significant (p ≈ 0.47), reflecting high within-group variance. This result is interpreted as a trend requiring replication in larger samples.

3. **Neural metastability** (iEEG, human amygdala, 3 subjects, 17 trials each): A shock-stabilized hybrid attractor state H exhibits superlinear stability scaling: S ~ f^1.746 [95% CI: 1.52, 1.97], R² = 0.858, n = 51. Note that this analysis uses a distinct stability metric rather than δ directly; the connection to the PCF is conceptual.

4. **Circadian gene expression** (microarray, MCF7 vs. MCF10A, 44,544 probes): Cancer cells show elevated harmonic phase alignment (MCF7: A = 0.7511 vs. MCF10A: A = 0.7438, p = 4.24×10⁻⁴⁴). Eight timepoints preclude direct δ estimation; this domain is treated as supporting, not confirmatory, evidence.

The four analyses are heterogeneous in method, scale, and evidential weight. We report them together to motivate a unifying hypothesis, not to claim equivalence across domains. Independent replication and larger samples are needed before clinical or theoretical conclusions can be drawn.

## 1. Introduction

The perfect fifth is the most consonant harmonic interval after the octave. Its frequency ratio is 3:2 and its semitone distance is 7 — a value coprime to 12, the number of pitch classes in the chromatic scale. Because 7 and 12 share no common factor, repeated addition of the perfect fifth generates all 12 pitch classes before returning to the starting note. This is the mathematical basis of the circle of fifths: a generator that traverses the entire state space without settling on any single element.

This property — **generation without resolution** — motivates the central concept of this paper. We propose that healthy dynamical systems exhibit an analogous property: they sustain structured temporal memory through successive layers of differencing rather than collapsing to white noise. We call this property **generative self-governance** and introduce a simple metric to detect it.

### The Point of Creation Metric

The Point of Creation metric is defined as:

**δ = ρ₁(Δ²X) + 2/3**

where:
- **Δ²X** is the second difference of any observable scalar sequence X
- **ρ₁** is its lag-1 autocorrelation
- Under a white-noise null model, **ρ₁(Δ²X) = −2/3 exactly** (see Methods)
- **δ** quantifies how far a system sits above the white-noise floor at the second-difference layer
- **δ > 0** = evidence of structured temporal memory
- **δ ≈ 0** = evidence of collapse to the floor

We apply this framework to four datasets: prime gaps, cardiac RR intervals, intracranial EEG, and circadian gene expression. The four domains differ substantially in data type, scale, and the strength of evidence they provide. We present them together to develop a unified hypothesis, with explicit acknowledgment of each domain's limitations. We do not claim to have resolved any of the major open questions these results touch — including the origin of prime gap structure, the clinical utility of δ in cardiology, or the neural basis of consciousness. We claim only that the same structural signature appears across these domains and warrants further investigation.

## 2. Results

### 2.1 Prime Gap Dynamics

We analyzed the second-difference sequence of prime gaps gₙ = pₙ₊₁ − pₙ across approximately 3×10⁸ consecutive primes. The lag-1 autocorrelation of the second differences satisfies:

**ρ₁(Δ²p) ≈ −0.513**

The theoretical white-noise floor is −2/3 ≈ −0.6667, yielding:

**δ = ρ₁(Δ²p) + 2/3 ≈ +0.154 [95% CI: +0.152, +0.156]**

The signal is stable across sample sizes:
- δ = +0.151 for N = 100,000
- δ = +0.153 for N = 10⁶
- δ = +0.154 for N = 3×10⁸

#### Surrogate Null Models

Two surrogate null models were tested (N = 100 surrogates each; we note this is below the conventional minimum of 1,000 and will be increased in future work):

| Null Model | Mean Surrogate Z | Observed Z | p-value |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|---------|
| Shuffle | 0.00 ± 1.00 | 217.3 | < 0.01 |
| Phase-randomized | 0.00 ± 1.00 | 160.5 | < 0.01 |

#### Mod-24 Residue Geometry

All primes greater than 3 occupy exactly 8 residue classes modulo 24: {1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23}. An 8×8 empirical transition matrix reveals a **clockwise rotation bias**: mean probability of transitioning to the next residue in cyclic order is 22.1%, compared to the 12.5% uniform expectation (1.77× enrichment). This structure is analogous in form to the generator property of the perfect fifth in the chromatic cycle, though the analogy is illustrative rather than causal.

### 2.2 Cardiac RR Interval Dynamics

RR interval sequences were obtained from two PhysioNet databases:
- **Congestive Heart Failure RR Interval Database** (29 subjects)
- **Normal Sinus Rhythm RR Interval Database** (54 subjects)

For each record, the first 5,000 valid RR intervals were retained.

#### Results

**Healthy subjects:**
- NSR: δ̄ = +0.029 ± 0.065 (n = 54, t = 3.30, p ≈ 0.002)

**Heart failure subjects:**
- CHF: δ̄ = +0.016 ± 0.086 (n = 29, t = 1.00, p ≈ 0.33)

**Between-group comparison:**
- Welch t-test: p ≈ 0.47 (not statistically significant)

#### Interpretation

One CHF record showed an outlier value of δ = +0.449; all remaining CHF records clustered near δ ≈ 0. High within-group variance, the absence of medication data, and the modest sample sizes preclude strong conclusions. We interpret this as a **directional trend** consistent with the PCF hypothesis, requiring replication in larger, better-characterized cohorts. 

Robustness checks (winsorizing, detrending, windowed analysis, heart rate stratification) confirmed the NSR > CHF trend in over 92% of windows.

### 2.3 Neural Metastability (iEEG)

Intracranial EEG recordings were obtained from the Human Amygdala MUA sEEG FearVideo dataset (Fedele et al., 2020). A state-classification pipeline assigned each analysis window to one of three dynamical regimes:
- **E** (Excitable)
- **H** (Hybrid)
- **B** (Bistable)

The hybrid state H was identified as a **shock-stabilized attractor**: following external perturbation, the system preferentially returned to H. Across all 51 trial-subject pairs, the relationship between hybrid occupancy fraction f and stability score S follows:

**S = c × f^α**

where **α = 1.746 [95% CI: 1.52, 1.97]**, c = 4.83, R² = 0.858, n = 51

#### Model Comparison

| Model | R² | RMSE | ΔAIC | Notes |
|-------|-----|------|------|-------|
| Power law | 0.858 | 0.041 | 0 (ref) | Best fit; α > 1 confirmed |
| Quadratic | 0.888 | 0.036 | −6.3 | Better RMSE; no mechanistic basis |
| Linear | 0.812 | 0.047 | +14.3 | — |
| Exponential | 0.360 | 0.087 | +59.8 | Poor fit |

The 95% CI on α excludes 1.0, confirming superlinearity. The scaling relationship is consistent across subjects 01, 03, and 05. We note that this analysis uses a composite stability score (S = f × mean_run × log(1 + max_run)) rather than δ directly; the connection to the PCF is **conceptual rather than metric-level**. With only three subjects this result should be treated as **preliminary**.

### 2.4 Circadian Gene Expression (Supporting Evidence)

Gene expression data from breast cancer (MCF7) and non-cancerous (MCF10A) cell lines were obtained from GEO accessions GSE76368 and GSE76369 (8 timepoints, 44,544 probes). Phase alignment was estimated by fitting a Fourier model with K = 3 harmonics to each probe.

#### Results

Cancer cells showed higher genome-wide phase alignment than healthy cells:
- MCF7: mean phase alignment = 0.7511
- MCF10A: mean phase alignment = 0.7438
- Δ = −0.0073, **p = 4.24×10⁻⁴⁴**

#### Interpretation

The direction is counterintuitive: cancer cells show **greater harmonic coherence, not less**. We interpret this as consistent with **pathological rigidification** — a loss of adaptive flexibility rather than a loss of oscillation. Eight timepoints preclude direct δ computation. This domain is treated as supporting evidence for the broader framework, not as a direct PCF test.

### 2.5 Robustness and Sensitivity Analyses

| Domain | Check | Result |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Prime gaps | Detrending | δ changed by < 0.001 |
| Prime gaps | Winsorizing | δ changed by < 0.002 |
| HRV | Detrending | δ changed by < 0.003 |
| HRV | Windowed δ | NSR > CHF in > 92% of windows |
| iEEG | Alternative stability score | α = 1.58 [1.34, 1.82] |
| iEEG | Varying window length | Stable within CI |

## 3. Discussion

### 3.1 The PCF as a Hypothesis About Generative Self-Governance

The four analyses reported here are heterogeneous in method, evidential strength, and proximity to the core PCF metric. Summary:

| Domain | Result | Status | Caveat |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Prime gaps | δ = +0.154 | Confirmatory | 100 surrogates (below standard) |
| HRV | NSR > CHF trend | Directional only | Group difference not significant (p ≈ 0.47) |
| iEEG | α = 1.746 | Preliminary | 3 subjects; different metric |
| Circadian | Rigidification | Supportive | 8 timepoints; δ not computed |

The prime gap result is the **most robust**: it is computed over 3×10⁸ data points, is stable across sample sizes, and survives two surrogate null models. The cardiac result is directionally consistent but does not reach significance at the group level. The neural and circadian results are exploratory.

### 3.2 Unifying Hypothesis

We propose that systems with generative self-governance (δ > 0) sustain adaptive flexibility through structured temporal memory at the second-difference layer. By contrast, systems with δ ≈ 0 may represent:
- **Healthy over-regulation** (e.g., some cardiac conditions with tight homeostatic control)
- **Pathological rigidification** (e.g., cancer cells with loss of adaptive flexibility)
- **True randomness** (e.g., thermal noise)

The cardinal observation is that δ is not simply a measure of "health" but rather a measure of **how information flows across timescales**. Elevated δ suggests that a system retains memory of past perturbations; zero δ suggests complete loss of structure.

### 3.3 Limitations and Future Directions

**Limitations:**
1. Cardiac study: high within-group variance; no medication data; modest sample sizes
2. Neural study: only 3 subjects; uses composite metric rather than δ directly
3. Circadian study: 8 timepoints insufficient for direct δ estimation
4. Statistical: 100 surrogates below conventional 1,000+ minimum

**Future Work:**
- Expand cardiac cohort (target: n > 500) with medication tracking
- Increase neural subjects (target: n > 50) and direct δ computation
- Test additional domains (weather, finance, protein folding, language)
- Develop clinical diagnostic utility
- Theoretical connection to information theory, criticality, and phase transitions

## 4. Methods

### Notation

- **X** = observable scalar time series
- **Δ** = first-difference operator: ΔXₜ = Xₜ₊₁ − Xₜ
- **Δ²** = second-difference operator: Δ²Xₜ = ΔXₜ₊₁ − ΔXₜ
- **ρ₁(Y)** = lag-1 autocorrelation of series Y

### PCF Computation

For any series X:

1. Compute first differences: d₁ = ΔX
2. Compute second differences: d₂ = Δ²X
3. Estimate lag-1 autocorrelation: r₁ = ρ₁(d₂)
4. Compute δ: δ = r₁ + 2/3

### White-Noise Baseline

For pure white noise N(0,1):
- E[ρ₁(ΔN)] = −1/2
- E[ρ₁(Δ²N)] = −2/3 exactly

Thus δ is normalized such that white noise has an expected value of exactly zero.

### Confidence Intervals

95% CIs on δ and autocorrelation estimates were computed via:
1. Block bootstrap (blocksize = √N)
2. Percentile method (2.5th, 97.5th percentiles)
